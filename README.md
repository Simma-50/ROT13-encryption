# ROT13-encryption
ROT13 (rotate by 13 places) is a symmetric encryption that substitutes the letter with the 13 letter after it in the alphabet. The English alphabet consists of 26 letters, therefore using ROT13 twice returns the original text. Because of its ability to function as both an encryption and decryption method without requiring a key exchange, it is regarded as symmetric cipher.
